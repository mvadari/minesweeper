# Minesweeper Solver

A Minesweeper solver. 

Currently there is one version, based on logic rules. 

In the future, there will be a solver that uses machine learning. 

To run the logic solver, run `python3 run.py`. Currently, this runs the solver until it fails. 

## Requirements

The only requirement is Python 3. This may also be compatible with Python 2.
